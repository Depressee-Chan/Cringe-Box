# Cringe-Box
Cringe-Box is a CLI video player that gets video streams from FTP servers and then converts the frames to ASCII characters which are then played in the terminal. Users can also play videos from local files. Framerates are horrific.

## How to use
1) find some FTP servers or local video files that you want to play
2) make sure that all the proper dependencies are installed
3) run "cringe_box.py" in a CLI with the comand ```python3 cringe_box.py```
4) enjoy trying to figure out what's going on in the video as your CPU useage skyrockets and your framerates drop like the NASDAQ
